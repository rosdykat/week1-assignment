User Stories
What are user stories?
Planning at the start of the project helps both stakeholders and the project team agree on the requirements and the desired outcomes. Defining what the application should do using “user stories” is one way to set the scope for a whole app, website or even just a new feature.

When you can say the product delivers all of the agreed stories, that scope of work is finished (and you can request final payment!). Without this kind of planning it can be easy to get lost in the details and lose sight of the initial goals.

User stories help keep the focus on the user, and what the product does to meet their needs.

User stories are often written in a templated style:

As a (user role), I want (goal) so that (benefit).

This assignment’s user stories are as follows:

🐿️ As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
🐿️ As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
🐿️ As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.
Requirements
🎯 Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
🎯 Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths.
How to Deploy
Once everything is added, committed and pushed to GitHub:

Go to the project GitHub repo
Go to ‘Settings’
In the sidebar, go to ‘Pages’
In ‘Build and Deployment’ > ‘Branch’, select the ‘main’ branch from the drop-down and save
Wait a minute or so, and your website is deployed!
Stretch Goals
To achieve a 4/4 in your assignment, aim to achieve all of the requirements, plus something extra. This can be excellence in styling or something that demonstrates creativity or innovation in the week’s topics.

Below are some examples of stretch goals and user stories that you could add to your project, but are not expected to.

Stretch User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to have a “back to top” button so that I can easily return to the top without manually scrolling.
🐿️ As a user, I want smooth scrolling for internal links so that I can have a seamless and enjoyable navigation experience within the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want buttons to have a hover effect so that they appear more interactive and I can easily identify clickable elements.
🐿️ As a user, I want a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages so that I can easily connect with the website on social platforms.
🐿️ As a user, I want a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads so that I can have an enhanced and enjoyable browsing experience.
